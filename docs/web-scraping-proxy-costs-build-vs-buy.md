# Web Scraping Proxy Costs: Build vs. Buy Your Stealth Stack

Almost every published "build vs. buy" comparison in this space is written by a company
selling the buy side, and it shows in the numbers: a precise, large multi-year total for
building it yourself next to a vague or absent total for their own service, in the same
table. That doesn't make the underlying tradeoff fake, proxy bandwidth costs real money
and maintaining scrapers against sites that keep changing costs real engineering time,
but it means the specific dollar figures circulating online deserve the same skepticism
[this corpus recommends for any benchmark with a stake in its own outcome](how-to-read-a-stealth-browser-benchmark.md).
This page tries to separate what's actually checkable from what's a vendor's own
arithmetic, and to name the tradeoff honestly where a precise number isn't available. No
proxy provider or scraping-API vendor is named here by brand; the categories matter more
than which company sells into them.

## What "build" actually costs

Three real cost buckets, in different amounts of certainty.

**Proxy bandwidth, which is the one with an actual public price tag.** Residential proxy
bandwidth is typically billed per gigabyte, and publicly listed rates span roughly an
order of magnitude, a bit over a dollar per GB at the low end to eight dollars or more at
the premium end, before minimum monthly commitments, non-flat volume tiers, and
promotional first-month pricing change the effective number you actually pay. The sticker
price is a real number; it is also not the number that ends up on your invoice at scale,
because minimums and tiering do most of the work of separating the two. Budget from the
range, not from the lowest number you find.

**Engineering maintenance, which is real but genuinely hard to put a clean dollar figure
on.** The closest thing to independent evidence here isn't from this space specifically:
Monte Carlo's 2022 State of Data Quality survey, run with Wakefield Research across 300
data professionals with a disclosed methodology and date range, found that data engineers
report spending around 40% of their time on data-quality firefighting broadly, not web
scraping specifically, but the underlying pattern, pipelines that silently degrade and
need ongoing human attention, is the same shape a scraper has when its target changes
under it. A 2023 academic paper on web-scraped data,
["Should we trust web-scraped data?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02231) by Jens
Foerderer, makes the more specific point: content volatility, sites changing over time,
is itself a source of sampling bias in scraped data, independent of whether the scraper
throws an error or just silently returns something wrong. Neither source gives you a
dollar figure you can drop into a spreadsheet. Both are real evidence that "build it once"
is not a stable state, which is the actual point most vendor calculators are gesturing at
with numbers this page won't repeat as fact.

**The ground itself moves, and not slowly.** In July 2025 Cloudflare switched its
default posture for new domains from allowing automated crawling to blocking AI crawlers
by default, moving from an opt-out model to opt-in, and announced a further default
change for September 2026 blocking training and agent bots on ad-monetized pages by
default. That's one infrastructure provider, on a public, dated timeline, changing the
baseline every site behind it inherits without any of them individually deciding to. A
team that built its own stack against last year's landscape is maintaining against a
target that moves whether or not their code does.

## What "buy" actually costs, including the part the pitch doesn't lead with

A managed scraping API shifts some of the maintenance burden onto the vendor, that's the
actual product, but it doesn't make the underlying costs disappear, and two things about
it are worth being precise about.

**It usually still charges by volume**, per request or per GB, the same axis proxy
bandwidth is billed on. At high enough volume, a managed service's per-unit price and a
self-hosted proxy's per-GB price are the same kind of number, and which one is cheaper is
a real calculation specific to your volume, not a foregone conclusion in either
direction. The pitch that buying eliminates the proxy cost line is usually wrong; it more
often bundles that cost into a different line item.

**"Managed" does not always mean the IP problem is solved for you.** Two different
product shapes get marketed under similar language. A scraping API that returns parsed
or rendered data typically does bundle proxy sourcing into its price, that's most of
what you're paying for. A hosted or remote browser endpoint, sold as automation
infrastructure rather than a full data API, more often hands you a browser to drive and
still expects you to supply your own proxy configuration. Reading a product page closely
enough to know which shape you're buying, before assuming "managed" means you're done
thinking about IPs, saves a mid-integration surprise that shows up often enough to be
worth naming explicitly.

**Vendor lock-in is a real, if unglamorous, cost.** Once your retry logic, error
handling, and response parsing are written against one vendor's API shape and its
specific quirks, [rate limits and retry behavior differ enough between providers to need
their own handling](agent-retry-loops-rate-limits.md), switching later is itself an
engineering project, not a config change. That cost is real and rarely appears in a
vendor's own comparison table, for the obvious reason that naming it would undercut the
pitch.

## The decision usually isn't binary

Most teams that build their own automation layer still buy their proxy bandwidth,
because those are genuinely different businesses. Operating a residential proxy network
means recruiting and maintaining a pool of real exit devices at scale, which has nothing
to do with browser engineering and isn't something most teams should be building
regardless of how they answer the rest of this question.
[This corpus says the same thing from the other side, repeatedly](vs-curl-cffi.md): a
real engine answers the fingerprint and the handshake, you still supply the clean proxy
and the human pacing, no automation tool changes that split. The realistic choice for
most teams isn't "build everything" versus "buy everything." It's which layers to build
and which to buy, and proxy sourcing lands on the buy side of that line more often than
any other single component.

## A framework for the actual decision

Questions worth answering before either dollar figure matters:

- **What's your actual volume, and how does it grow?** Per-unit comparisons only mean
  something at the volume you'll actually run, not at a vendor's example tier or your
  current pilot scale.
- **How many distinct target shapes do you maintain?** One stable site behaves nothing
  like fifty sites with independent markup and independent anti-bot postures; the
  maintenance-burden evidence above scales with the second number, not the first.
- **What's your team's actual spare engineering capacity, and its opportunity cost?**
  Time spent maintaining scrapers is time not spent on whatever else that engineer would
  build; whether that tradeoff is acceptable depends on what the alternative use of that
  time is worth to you, which no vendor's calculator can know.
- **Do you need the data, or do you need control over how it's collected?** A pure
  data-out need points toward buying a managed API. A need to control exact browser
  behavior, timing, session handling, or engine-level fingerprint fidelity points toward
  building on top of an automation library, because a managed API's internals aren't
  yours to inspect or adjust.
- **How much does vendor lock-in actually cost you if you're wrong?** Higher for a
  deeply-integrated managed API, lower for a proxy-only purchase sitting behind your own
  automation code, since only the exit IP changes if you switch providers.

## Where this project sits in that decision

`invisible_playwright` is the automation and engine-level stealth layer on the build side
of this question, a patched Firefox driven by stock Playwright. It is not a proxy source
and not a managed scraping API, and it does not remove either of those cost buckets from
your build column. What it removes is a narrower thing: the engineering work of getting
a browser's JavaScript-observable surface to read as genuine, which you would otherwise
have to build and maintain yourself if you chose the "build" side of this decision. It
doesn't decide the question this page is about; it only changes what building actually
costs once you've decided to build.

## Conclusion

The proxy-bandwidth line has a real, checkable public price range, order of magnitude a
few dollars per GB, with sticker price and effective price differing more than most
comparisons admit. The engineering-maintenance line is real but resists a clean number;
the best evidence available is adjacent (a data-quality survey, an academic paper on
scraping bias) rather than a scraping-specific, independently audited figure, and this
page has deliberately not manufactured one to fill that gap. What's actually verifiable
and dated is that the target landscape moves under both build and buy alike, Cloudflare's
own 2025 policy shift being one public example. Most teams end up buying proxy bandwidth
regardless of which side they land on for automation, because sourcing clean exit IPs at
scale is a different business than browser engineering. The specific total any vendor's
page quotes you, on either side, deserves the same question this page opened with: who
computed that number, and what did they have riding on the answer.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Is it cheaper to build or buy web scraping infrastructure?** It depends on your volume,
how many distinct sites you maintain, and your team's spare engineering capacity, none of
which a generic vendor comparison can know about your situation. Treat any published total
as an input to your own calculation, not an answer.

**Do managed scraping services still require me to supply proxies?** Sometimes. A
full scraping API that returns data usually bundles proxy sourcing into its price. A
hosted or remote browser endpoint sold as infrastructure more often expects you to bring
your own proxy configuration. Check which product shape you're actually buying.

**How much does residential proxy bandwidth cost?** Publicly listed per-GB prices span
roughly an order of magnitude as of 2025-2026, with the effective price usually higher
than the advertised rate once minimum commitments and tiering apply. There is no single
market rate to quote.

**Why do build-vs-buy comparisons always favor buying?** Because most of the ones that
circulate are published by a company selling the managed alternative, and they set the
assumptions (engineer hourly rate, maintenance hours, proxy price) that produce their own
total. That doesn't make the tradeoff fake, but it does mean the specific numbers deserve
scrutiny.

**Does building my own stack mean I don't need a proxy vendor?** No. Most teams that
build their own automation layer still buy proxy bandwidth from someone else, because
operating a residential proxy network is a different business from browser automation
engineering.

**Does invisible_playwright replace a managed scraping API?** No. It's an automation and
engine-level stealth layer for the build side of this decision. It doesn't source
proxies and doesn't manage infrastructure; it changes what building the browser layer
costs, not whether you should build instead of buy.

**What's the one number in this page you'd trust most?** The dated one: Cloudflare's July
2025 shift to blocking AI crawlers by default, because it's a specific, checkable policy
change from a named party with no stake in this page's argument either way.
