# Does Playwright Trigger hCaptcha More Often?

Often, yes. hCaptcha runs an invisible risk pass before it ever shows anything, and a
default Playwright session gives that pass more reasons to escalate than a browser a
person has actually been using does. That is not a single "this is Playwright" flag
either. It is the same shape of problem covered on
[the reCAPTCHA version of this page](does-playwright-trigger-recaptcha.md): several
inputs, most of them not published, several of them pushed the wrong way at once by a
fresh automated context.

[hCaptcha, Explained](hcaptcha-explained.md) covers the two-stage mechanism in full,
the invisible pass and the visual puzzle it falls back to. This page is about what tips
that first stage toward showing you the second one, and which parts of that a
patched, engine-level browser can actually change.

## What the invisible pass is deciding

hCaptcha's own documentation frames the decision at category level only: a challenge
appears based on "computed confidence in the visitor's humanity, the site difficulty
setting, and other security factors," and hCaptcha's Pro-tier docs describe the
underlying evaluation as drawn from "thousands of factors," aimed at keeping visible
challenges under roughly 0.1% of real visitors. Neither document names the specific
signals or their weights, and this page does not claim to know them either, the same
honesty this corpus applies to [Arkose's undisclosed "225+ risk signals"](arkose-labs-funcaptcha-explained.md#what-arkoses-own-materials-say-and-where-they-stop).

What is confirmed, from hCaptcha's own API surface, is that the server-side
`siteverify` call accepts an optional `remoteip` parameter that hCaptcha's own docs say
improves the check's accuracy, which is a direct acknowledgment that the requesting
address is one of the inputs, alongside whatever the client-side script itself collects.

## The inputs that plausibly feed the score

Reasoning from what a browser-based risk pass generally reads, and from hCaptcha's own
partial disclosures, the same broad families that drive
[reCAPTCHA's score](does-playwright-trigger-recaptcha.md#the-inputs-that-feed-the-score)
apply here too:

- **Fingerprint and engine consistency.** Whether the browser's claimed identity agrees
  with how it actually behaves, an inconsistency this corpus has documented in general
  through [`navigator.webdriver`](does-playwright-set-navigator-webdriver.md) and other
  automation tells that a stock automated launch leaves in place.
- **IP reputation.** Confirmed as an input via the `remoteip` parameter above. A
  datacenter address or one already flagged by other traffic raises suspicion regardless
  of what the browser reports.
- **Session and cookie history.** A brand-new context with nothing behind it looks
  different from a browser that has actually been used, the same "a fresh profile has no
  past" argument [made in full on the reCAPTCHA v3 score page](recaptcha-v3-score.md).
- **Interaction pattern.** How the page got its click or its keystrokes, before the
  challenge ever renders, is part of what "other security factors" plausibly covers,
  though hCaptcha's own docs do not spell this out explicitly.

One nuance worth being precise about: hCaptcha's own marketing draws a contrast with
"traditional fingerprints," describing its passive modes as working "without
fingerprinting" and framing device fingerprints as becoming obsolete as a detection
tool. Read that as a positioning claim about where hCaptcha says it is putting its
effort, not as proof that browser-level consistency checks play no role at all in the
undisclosed "thousands of factors." hCaptcha does not publish enough for either reading
to be stated as settled fact, and this page does not pretend otherwise.

## Which input the browser layer actually moves

Of those families, the browser engine itself can only speak to one: whether the
JavaScript-visible surface of the browser is internally consistent and behaves like a
genuine instance of the engine it claims to be. Stock Playwright driving stock Firefox
or Chromium leaves a scattering of small disagreements here, an automation property
like `navigator.webdriver`, a headless context missing a real GPU, a font set or codec
list that does not match the claimed platform. Each one is a plausible, if unconfirmed,
contributor to whatever "other security factors" hCaptcha's decision actually weighs.

IP reputation, session history and interaction pattern are not properties of the
browser engine at all. No amount of patching below the JavaScript layer manufactures a
browsing history, warms a cold IP, or paces a click for you.

## What invisible_playwright does, and a two-line example

invisible_playwright is a Firefox patched at the C++ level and driven by stock
Playwright. Its contribution to this specific problem is the fingerprint-and-engine
input: instead of a scattering of disagreements, it presents one coherent real Firefox,
with GPU, audio, fonts, screen and roughly 400 fields derived together from a single
seed so they agree with each other and with a genuine desktop build.

Switching from plain Playwright is two lines, and every Playwright method works
unchanged because the returned object is a real Playwright
[`Browser`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser):

```python
from invisible_playwright import InvisiblePlaywright

# seed=42 makes the identity reproducible: same GPU, fonts, canvas hash every run
with InvisiblePlaywright(seed=42, proxy={
    "server": "socks5://gate.example.com:1080",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
}) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com/signup")
    page.click("#submit")   # pointer arcs to the button on a Bezier curve
```

The reproducible seed matters for debugging this specific problem: if a run escalates
to hCaptcha's visual challenge, replay the exact same identity and change one variable,
the proxy, the timing, the target page, at a time, rather than guessing whether the
site's own thresholds moved or the browser did.

What this buys you is a smaller fingerprint-and-consistency contribution to whatever the
invisible pass weighs. It does not touch the address you connect from, the history that
session does or does not carry, or the rhythm of your own clicks, and it does not
"solve" hCaptcha's pass/fail decision. There is no such thing, and this project does not
claim to have found one.

## The inputs the browser cannot move

These stay yours to bring, and no browser-engine patch substitutes for them:

- **IP reputation.** A perfect fingerprint on a listed or overused address is still on a
  bad address. Rule out the exit first; see
  [how ASN and IP reputation feed bot detection](asn-and-ip-reputation-in-bot-detection.md).
- **Session age.** A cookieless, day-zero context reads as fresh every single time.
  Warming a session or reusing storage state moves this, and it is not the browser's job.
- **Behavior and timing.** Mechanical pacing scores against you no matter how real the
  browser looks underneath it.

If the fingerprint is coherent and the visible puzzle still shows up, the cause is one
of these three, not the engine.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Does Playwright itself get flagged by hCaptcha?** Not as a single named flag. hCaptcha
does not publish its criteria, but a default Playwright session tends to combine an
inconsistent browser fingerprint with a fresh, historyless session, both plausible
contributors to whatever pushes the invisible pass toward escalating.

**Will a stealth browser stop hCaptcha's visual challenge from appearing?** It can lower
the fingerprint-and-engine-consistency contribution. It does nothing for the IP address,
the session's age, or your own timing, so on its own it will not stop every challenge.

**Can any browser guarantee I never see the puzzle?** No. hCaptcha's decision draws on
undisclosed inputs the browser does not fully control, and even if it did, this project
does not sell or claim a captcha-solving outcome for the puzzle itself.

**Is it the IP or the browser?** Test it directly: visit the same page by hand from the
same machine and network. If the manual visit also escalates, look at the exit first,
using [the detection checklist](playwright-detected-as-bot.md) to work the split in
order.

**Does hCaptcha's "no fingerprinting" claim mean the browser doesn't matter?** Not
necessarily. It is hCaptcha's own positioning against traditional device fingerprints,
not a disclosure of the full input list behind its "thousands of factors." Treat it as a
marketing claim to weigh, not as proof the browser layer is irrelevant.
