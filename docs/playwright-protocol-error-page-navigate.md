# Playwright "Protocol Error (Page.navigate)"

`Page.navigate` is not a Chromium-only string. It is the internal channel-and-method
name Playwright's own driver uses for a navigation command, and reports of it firing
verbatim show up against Chromium and Firefox alike: one regression report tracking a
1.53.2-to-1.54.0 break names the failure on `browser.newContext` before a single page
even opens, and another, older regression naming the same string is filed as affecting
"Chromium and Firefox" together. This is a Playwright-internal transport error, not a
browser-engine one, which is the opposite of most protocol strings that reach the
surface with an engine's name already stamped on them.

That distinction matters because it is easy to read `Page.navigate` as CDP jargon and
go looking for a Chromium net-stack explanation that does not apply here.

## How this differs from TargetClosedError

[`TargetClosedError`](playwright-targetclosederror-causes.md) is what you get when the
thing Playwright was talking to is already gone: the call goes out, there is nothing left
on the other end to answer it, and the client reports the disconnection. A
`Protocol error (Page.navigate): <reason>` is a different point in the same pipe. The
call went out, a response came back, and the response was a refusal naming a specific
reason. The target did not vanish. The navigate command itself was rejected.

In practice the two can sit right next to each other in a stack trace, because a
rejected navigate can be the thing that then closes the context around it. Read the
text after the colon before assuming either one. If it names an invalid URL, treat it
as this page. If it says nothing more specific than "closed," it belongs on the
`TargetClosedError` page instead, whose three Firefox and Juggler causes are a
different diagnosis entirely.

## Cause 1: the URL you actually sent was invalid

**Verbatim symptom:**

```
Error: page.goto: Protocol error (Page.navigate): Cannot navigate to invalid URL
```

This is the most literal reading and the most common one. `page.goto("")`, a relative
path with no `baseURL` configured to resolve it against, or a string that never was a
URL (an empty template interpolation, a `None` serialized to text) all produce the
identical rejection. The browser is not being picky; an empty string or a bare path
segment is not a URL by any standard, and both engines refuse it identically.

**How to confirm it:** print the exact value handed to `goto()` immediately before the
call. Not the variable you believe holds it, the value at the call site. This alone
resolves most reports of this cause, because the mismatch between "what I thought I
sent" and "what actually left the process" is the whole bug.

## Cause 2: Playwright's own client built the invalid URL for you

This is the less obvious variant, and it is worth knowing about specifically because it
looks identical to cause 1 while the fix is different. A `baseURL` set in configuration
gets combined with whatever you pass to `goto()` using URL-construction rules, and a
regression tracked between Playwright 1.53.2 and 1.54.0 shows exactly this: a plain
`await page.goto('/')` that had worked started failing with
`Error: browser.newContext: Protocol error (Page.navigate): Cannot navigate to invalid URL`
after a change in how that combination was resolved internally, with no change to the
calling code. A second, older regression between 1.38 and 1.39 hit the same string only
inside a custom worker-scoped fixture, where a relative URL that worked fine when called
directly from a test failed when the page was constructed through the fixture instead.

In both cases the browser is rejecting a URL that Playwright's own client assembled, not
one you typed by hand, which is why grepping your own code for the literal string
`goto(` will not find the bug.

**How to confirm it:** check whether the failure appeared right after a Playwright
version bump, and whether your `goto()` calls go through a `baseURL` or a custom
fixture rather than a bare absolute URL at the call site. If either is true, pin the
last known-good Playwright version and confirm the failure disappears before filing
this as your own code's mistake.

## Cause 3: the message names nothing specific

**Verbatim symptom:** the same `Protocol error (Page.navigate): ...` prefix, but the
text after it is generic (`Target closed`, or nothing at all) rather than naming an
invalid URL.

This is not this page's cause. It is the target closing at the moment the navigate
command was sent, and the three specific Firefox and Juggler reasons that produces are
already broken down, with their own verbatim symptoms, on
[the `TargetClosedError` page](playwright-targetclosederror-causes.md): the automation
layer missing from a build, a rejected protocol field from client/browser version
drift, or a content process crash mid-navigation. Do not spend time on URL construction
if the text does not mention a URL.

## Diagnostic checklist

1. Read everything after `Page.navigate):` before doing anything else. "Invalid URL"
   sends you to causes 1 and 2. Anything else sends you to the `TargetClosedError` page.
2. Log the literal argument passed to `goto()` at the call site, not the variable you
   assume holds it.
3. Check for a configured `baseURL` and whether the path you pass is empty, relative, or
   produces an unexpected join once combined with it.
4. Note whether the failure is new after a Playwright version bump. Two documented
   regressions (1.38 to 1.39, and 1.53.2 to 1.54.0) produced this exact string from
   correct calling code.
5. Check whether the failing `goto()` runs inside a custom fixture or a
   programmatically-created context rather than a plain test body; one regression only
   reproduced there.
6. If none of the above resolves it, treat it as `TargetClosedError` in disguise and work
   that page's three causes instead.

## What invisible_playwright does and does not touch here

This project patches the engine's fingerprint surface, not Playwright's own client-side
URL construction or its navigation command dispatch. A `Protocol error (Page.navigate)`
fires from the same client code and the same version-dependent baseURL logic whether the
browser underneath is a stock download or a Firefox patched at the C++ level. Nothing
about a coherent fingerprint changes what string a `goto()` call resolves to before it
ever reaches the browser.

## Conclusion

`Protocol error (Page.navigate)` is Playwright's own driver reporting that a navigate
command was refused, and the reason named after the colon tells you whether that is
about the URL or about something else entirely. An invalid or empty URL, often one
Playwright's client assembled from a `baseURL` rather than one you typed, accounts for
most reports; a generic or missing reason means the target closed and belongs on the
`TargetClosedError` diagnosis instead.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**What does "Protocol error (Page.navigate)" mean?** Playwright's navigation command was
sent and the browser (or Playwright's own client-side check) refused it, most often
because the URL was empty, relative with no base to resolve against, or otherwise
malformed.

**Is this a Chromium-only error?** No. It is Playwright's internal command name, and
reports of the identical string exist against both Chromium and Firefox.

**Is this the same as TargetClosedError?** No. `TargetClosedError` means the target was
already gone when the call was made. This is a live target refusing one specific
command. They can appear together when the refusal itself triggers a close.

**I did not pass an empty URL. Why does it still say "invalid URL"?** Check your
`baseURL` configuration and any custom fixture that constructs the page. Two documented
regressions produced this exact message from correct calling code, because Playwright's
own client built the invalid URL internally.

**Does upgrading or downgrading Playwright fix it?** It can, in both directions,
depending on which side of a specific regression you are on. Confirm against the
version where your code last worked before assuming a code change is required.

**Does invisible_playwright change how goto() resolves URLs?** No. URL construction and
navigation dispatch are Playwright's own client code, untouched by the engine patching
this project does.
