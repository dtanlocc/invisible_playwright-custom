"""E2E: run the REAL open-source detectors against the patched binary, on CI.

Instead of our own hand-rolled signal checks, this loads the actual detection
libraries and uses their FULL API surface:

  * BotD (@fingerprintjs/botd, MIT) - the client-side bot detector that
    FingerprintJS Pro itself uses. We assert the aggregate verdict
    (``detect().bot == False``) AND every one of its ~18 individual detectors
    (``getDetections()``) returns ``bot == False``.
  * FingerprintJS open-source (MIT) - ``get()`` must return a ``visitorId``
    that is STABLE across two fresh launches with the same seed, and a RICH
    component set (the fingerprint surface is real, not a stub).
  * fpscanner (antoinevastel/fpscanner 1.0.6, MIT) - ``collectFingerprint()``
    runs ~21 bot-detection rules in the browser. We assert the **engine-agnostic**
    subset (webdriver / selenium / bot-UA / platform / timezone / language) is
    clean. We deliberately do NOT assert the Chrome/GPU-only rules (hasCDP,
    hasPlaywright, hasSwiftshaderRenderer, hasMissingChromeObject, …): they're
    trivially clean on Firefox, and the GPU ones can legitimately fire on a
    software-WebGL CI host (Xvfb/llvmpipe) - asserting them would false-red.
  * CreepJS (abrahamjuliot/creepjs, MIT, pinned) - the gold-standard Firefox-aware
    headless/stealth/lie detector. It exposes its result on ``window.Fingerprint``.
    We assert ``headlessRating == 0`` (webdriver + headless-UA tells) and the
    JS-proxy stealth tells are absent. ``stealthRating`` / ``totalLies`` /
    ``likeHeadlessRating`` are LOGGED, not hard-asserted, because some of their
    sub-signals (hasBadWebGL, prefers-light-color) are GPU/theme-sensitive and
    differ on a GPU-less CI host.

Everything is hermetic: the libraries are vendored (tests/vendor/) and served
from a localhost HTTP server - no external CDN call. For CreepJS, every non-local
request is aborted, so its optional crowd-comparison POST never runs and the
verdict is computed purely locally. Runs identically on a dev box and a GH runner.

NOT covered: FingerprintJS *Pro* (commercial, server-side) - stays the local
realness gate.

def test_enumerate_devices_resolves_promptly(firefox_binary, detector_site):
    """navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices() must RESOLVE, and quickly.

    Born from a defect measured on 2026-08-10, and the point is that no test saw
    it even though it was the cause of four different failures.

    The symptom that was visible was
    `test_fingerprintjs_visitorid_stable_across_launches` going red roughly one
    time in three - a name that sends you the wrong way, because it had nothing
    to do with either the identifier or its stability. The detectors page stayed
    at `state='loading'`: BotD finished, FingerprintJS finished, fpscanner did
    not. Inside fpscanner:

        return new Promise(async function(t) {
          const a = await navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices();
          ...
          return t({...});                 // <- resolves AFTER the await
        });

    If `enumerateDevices()` never resolves, that promise never closes: no
    error, no exception, the page stays alive and responds to `evaluate`, and
    `wait_for_function` times out after 45 seconds. A browser that does not
    respond is easy to diagnose; one that waits forever is not.

    Measured: ONLY the first call costs anything - three consecutive calls in
    the same session give [1383, 2, 0] ms - so it is the media stack
    initialization, once per session. Through this wrapper the median is
    ~1440 ms and about 1 session in 8 never resolves at all; with plain
    Playwright, the SAME binary, the same prefs, the same environment and the
    same context options, the median is ~270 ms and 0 hangs out of 10. Ruled
    out by measurement: the binary, `media.navigator.streams.fake`, all 230
    prefs, the environment variables, the context options and the cursor
    engine. What remains inside the wrapper is open - see 70-known-bugs.md.

    ⛔ TWO LIMITS, NOT ONE, as of 2026-08-17, because with a single one this
    test reported "NEVER RESOLVED" for a resolution that was merely SLOW -
    that is, it wrote the defect's verdict over the loaded-machine's verdict.
    The first version had 5 seconds and failed 7 times out of 8 under load
    with times between 2.7 and 5 seconds; raising it to 30 moved the threshold
    without removing the confusion, and on 2026-08-17 ten full e2e runs gave
    1 red out of 10, with that red entirely inside the run that took 35
    minutes against a median of 11.8, i.e. the only outlier on every column.
    On the remaining nine runs: 0 out of 9.

    **The defect is the HANG, and a hang is infinite.** `BLOCK_LIMIT_MS` sits
    at 120 seconds: 83 times the median of ~1440 ms and 24 times the worst
    time ever observed when the call succeeds (5 s). Beyond that wall it is
    not slowness, and no load on this machine has ever produced anything
    like it. This is the only absolute limit, and it is the one that protects
    the product.

    **SLOWNESS, on the other hand, is measured against the machine, not
    against the clock.** The page times 20000 MICROTASKS, and the slowness
    limit is a multiple of that time, with a floor at 30 seconds and a
    ceiling below the block wall.

    ⛔ Microtasks, and not `setTimeout(...,0)`, for a measured reason: the
    first version of this reference counted 50 rounds of `setTimeout` and on
    an IDLE machine reported 2624 ms, i.e. ~52 ms per round. That was not
    load: it was the timer CLAMP, which Firefox applies regardless. The limit
    that derived from it came out to 393600 ms, **above** the block wall at
    120000, so the slowness assertion was unreachable - a dead assertion that
    looked like a protection. A reference must be chosen for what it measures,
    and a clamped timer measures the clamp. Microtasks are not clamped.

    The ceiling (`wall - 1`) exists for the same reason: if the slowness limit
    exceeds the block wall, the first assertion always fires first and the
    second one no longer exists. A limit that can never be reached is not a
    limit.

    The time and the reference are always printed, so a speed regression stays
    visible even when it does not make anything fail.
