"""The gate's copy of the generics map must not diverge from the core.

`scripts/ci_font_gate.py` carries a literal copy of
`zoom.stealth.fonts.generics`, and it is the only copy of that data in the
project. It exists for a narrow reason: the CI gate job installs only
Playwright, so `invisible_core` is not importable there and cannot become so
without changing the source repo's workflow, i.e. without rebuilding the five
archives.

Rule 16 forbids second sources. A copy nobody can see drifting would be
exactly that. This test binds it: if the core changes the declaration and the
gate falls behind, the suite goes red and the message says which of the two
moved.

Why it is REALLY needed, and is not a formality: without that declaration an
engine launched raw does not map the generics, because ever since the map is
declared instead of compiled the engine does not invent it (engine rule 7).
Measured 2026-08-11 on the same binary, raw launch on Linux: serif,
sans-serif, monospace, cursive and fantasy ALL collapse onto Arial. With the
declaration delivered they map onto Times New Roman, Arial, Consolas and Comic
Sans, with the exact same numbers as Windows.
