"""`position=` must reach the event, and the argument must reach the handle.

⛔ THESE TWO GUARD ONE DEFECT WITH TWO HALVES, and the halves hid each other.
The humanised cursor deliberately lands OFF-CENTRE and hands the point back to
the action through `position=`. On the Python transport neither half worked:

1. `ElementHandle.evaluateExpression` called `fn(element)` instead of
   `fn(element, arg)`, so the cursor's own hit test - which passes `{x, y}` as
   that argument - threw inside the page, was caught, and answered "no". The
   landing override was therefore never even computed.
2. And once it was computed and sent, the server ignored `position` for every
   pointer action, so the event landed on the geometric centre anyway.

⛔ THE CONSEQUENCE IS A TELL, NOT A MISSING FEATURE. Every element-targeted
action ended on `box.x + width/2, box.y + height/2`: one exact number, identical
in every install, readable from a single event. It was inert on the whole
transport and nothing failed - no exception, no red test, no warning.

Found by diffing the protocol against the Node driver: the driver's `click`
carried a `position` and ours did not.
