# ── The watchdog that says WHERE it is stuck, while it is still stuck ─────────
#
# The e2e hangs in 12% of CI runs (4 out of 33, from 2026-08-01 to 08-13) and
# until 2026-08-13 it left nothing behind: the job was killed by the 40-minute
# ceiling, so it came back `cancelled` and not `failure`, and the following
# steps never ran. `--timeout 420 --timeout-method thread` in run_e2e.py now
# kills it at 7 minutes printing the stack, but seven minutes is a long time
# and a single stack alone does not say whether the process is STUCK or just
# slow.
#
# This is what says it: at 150 seconds inside ONE test it prints the stack of
# every thread, and repeats it. Two identical dumps mean stuck; two different
# dumps mean slow. Those are opposite diagnoses and no other tool tells them
# apart.
#
# 150 seconds because the slowest legitimate test measured on CI is
# `test_webgl_readpixels_no_masking_signature` at 94.4 s, and the second at
# 11.4: on a healthy run it prints nothing, and on a slow runner it prints at
# most once, which is output and not a failure.
#
# To a FILE, not stderr, and this is not a detail: with pytest's default
# capture it redirects file descriptors 1 and 2 at the OS level, so even
# writing to the original `sys.__stderr__` ends up in the capture buffer -
# which pytest shows only once a failure has occurred, and here the process
# is being KILLED. Tested: with the threshold at 3 seconds on a test stuck in
# `accept()`, the same call prints four stacks when run by hand and ZERO
# under pytest. A file survives the kill and gets uploaded as an artifact on
# CI.
