"""The two RELEASE e2e files do not let the environment leak into the venv.

**Why this file exists.** `test_release_e2e.py` and `test_upgrade_e2e.py`
create a venv and install the package into it FROM THE INDEX: they are the
only thing that verifies what a user actually receives. But a venv INHERITS
the environment, and until 2026-08-14 `subprocess.run(env=None)` passed it
through intact. Measured on 2026-08-11: `PYTHONPATH` pointing at the bench's
sources and `INVISIBLE_SEAL_FILE` pointing at a local seal produced **sixteen
failures in one day, none of them the product's**. And the dangerous
direction is the other one: a GREEN that comes from an environment no user
has.

**Why it's a test and not a comment.** The fix lives in TWO copies, one per
file, and the duplication is enforced by a gate in the core
(`test_no_install_e2e_file_imports_a_package_the_runner_does_not_have`, in
`invisible_core/tests/test_marker_vocabulary.py`): those files must be
collectible with only stdlib and pytest on the runner, so a shared module
would be a collection error. Two copies diverge unless something compares
them.

The case that matters is the LAST one: the check that proves that without the
fix the variable would really get through. A test that only checks the
corrected version cannot distinguish "the fix works" from "the problem never
existed".
