"""What happens to somebody who ALREADY has this installed.

Every install test next door starts from an empty venv, which is the path a new
user takes exactly once. Every existing user takes a different one - `pip
install -U`, or an environment that has drifted - and none of it was covered.

That matters more here than in most packages, because of the shape of the
coupling: the wrapper declares an EXACT `invisible-core==X.Y.Z`, so an upgrade
has to move two distributions in step, and a half-moved environment is repaired
IN PROCESS at import rather than raising. A repair that silently does the wrong
thing therefore looks identical to one that worked - from the outside, the
import simply returns.

The failures these are aimed at:

  * `pip install -U invisible-playwright` leaves the OLD core behind, so the
    wrapper drives an engine configured by a core it was never tested against;
  * the repair runs when the core is already imported, swapping it underneath
    objects the caller holds - two versions alive in one process;
  * a user who pins an old core by hand gets a green `pip check` and a broken
    session, which is the failure mode the exact specifier was adopted to make
    loud in the first place.

Marked `e2e`: builds venvs and talks to the index.
