"""`wait_for_function` runs the CALLER'S code, so it runs in the CALLER'S world.

⛔ IT POLLED BEHIND THE XRAY, and that made it blind to exactly the thing people
wait for. Everything in this server evaluates in the utility world on purpose -
a site cannot count reads it cannot see - and two methods leave that world
because the caller asked for the page's own by name: `evaluate`, and this one.
The second was missed.

From the utility world a page global does not exist. So
`() => !!window.Fingerprint` is false forever, the call dies on its own timeout,
and the message names an expression that was true in the page the whole time.

**What it cost, measured 2026-08-28.** Five e2e tests failed on this transport
and passed on the driver: every one that waits for a real detector library to
finish. 181 of 186 were green, so the gap read as a detector problem rather than
as a world problem.

⛔ AND THE SECOND HALF ONLY APPEARED ONCE THE FIRST WAS FIXED. The call must
return a HANDLE: `_frame.py` wraps the reply in `from_channel(...)`, so
answering `None` raises `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute
'_object'` INSIDE the client, on a call that had just succeeded. While the poll
timed out first, that bug could not be reached.

⛔ And a handle born in the page's world cannot be read from the utility one: an
objectId is resolved inside the context it is given. The handle therefore
remembers which world it came from, and `json_value` asks there.
