"""CI font gate - assert the patched binary exposes exactly the Windows font
persona on EVERY host OS (Windows / Linux / macOS), with zero host-font leak.

The patched binary is bundle-only: at font-list construction it drops every host
system font and exposes only the bundled Windows-11 family set (the exposed set
IS the bundle). This gate launches the binary on its NATIVE runner - so
macOS/CoreText, Linux/fontconfig and Windows/DWrite are each tested for real -
enumerates the visible families with the same width-probe web detectors use, and
asserts three things:

  1. the detected family set == the canonical Windows set (EXPECTED): the SAME
     set on all three platforms. A leaked host font or a missing Windows one
     fails here. This is the "identical on every OS" contract.
  2. no known host family is visible (macOS: Helvetica Neue / Geneva / Menlo ...;
     Linux: DejaVu / Ubuntu ...) - a POSITIVE proof that block-at-birth ran for
     this platform's backend, not just "no obvious tell".
  3. the CSS generics resolve to Windows fonts (serif=Times New Roman,
     sans-serif=Arial, monospace=Consolas) and system-ui=Segoe UI.

This is the macOS validator the local Win/Linux gate cannot be - there is no
local Mac, so CoreText is only ever exercised here. Headless, no proxy, no
secrets, loopback-free (about:blank + arrow-function evaluate, which is not
eval and carries no CSP problem) -> safe in public CI.

Usage:  python ci_font_gate.py <firefox-binary>
Exit 0 + "FONT GATE OK ..." on success; non-zero + the diff on failure.

# The canonical Windows-11 family set the bundle exposes. Verified byte-for-byte
# identical on Windows/DWrite and Linux/fontconfig; macOS/CoreText must match it
# too. These are the `F|` records that `invisible_core` declares.
#
# ⛔ THIS IS A LITERAL, and the reason is NOT laziness: verified 2026-08-17 by
# reading the workflow that runs it. The font gate runs inside `release.yml`
# of the SOURCE repo, in a job that checks out THIS repo but installs only
# `playwright==...` and nothing else. Deriving it from `invisible_core` is the
# form rule 16 asks for, was written and tried, works locally, and kills EVERY
# release with an ImportError.
#
# And there is a second reason, which survives even if that job someday
# installed the core: when the pipeline runs, the PUBLISHED core is still the
# one from the previous release, because the core is published AFTER the
# binary exists (17-release-seal-spec.md §9). Deriving from there would
# measure the new binary against the old declaration.
#
# What keeps the literal honest is not the attention of whoever edits it: it
# is `test_the_family_list_in_the_gate_matches_the_core_manifest`, in
# `tests/test_ci_font_gate_declaration.py` of this repo, where the core IS
# present. That test did not exist: it was DOCUMENTED as existing and nothing
# more, and that is exactly why the list was able to stay at 68 while the
# manifest moved to 71 (the two icon Segoes plus Twemoji Mozilla).
#
# ⛔ AND THE DRIFT DOES NOT GIVE A RED, IT GIVES A GREEN: measured 2026-08-17
# on the real binary. The probe queries `EXPECTED + HOST_MUST_BE_ABSENT` and
# nothing else, so a family removed from here also stops being LOOKED FOR:
# with the three missing, the gate printed `detected 68 families (expected
# 68)` and `FONT GATE OK`, exit 0, on a binary that exposes 71. A gate that
# agrees with itself cannot see its own drift.

# removal closes the defect at its root instead of realigning it: now there is
# no list to keep in sync, because there is no list at all.
#
# The race these prefs meant to avoid no longer exists anywhere: it was not
# Fission, it was the preallocated new-tab browser grabbing the page's
