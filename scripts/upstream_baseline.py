"""Point Playwright's OWN test suite at our client, and count what passes.

⛔ THIS IS THE BASELINE THE CONTRACT WORK NEEDS, and taking it first is the
whole point. `tests/playwright-upstream/` holds Playwright's suite - 154 files,
2173 tests, 41596 lines - vendored as a reference copy and, until now, never run
against anything of ours: its `conftest.py` imports the real `playwright`
package, so it has only ever measured Microsoft's client.

The plan it serves: replacing the channel between our client and our server
removes the boundary `diff_protocol.py` compares across, so the judgement has to
move up a level, from the PROTOCOL to the CONTRACT. This suite is that judge -
but only if we know, before touching anything, which of those 2173 pass TODAY.
A baseline taken afterwards proves nothing: every failure would be arguable.

⛔ THE REFERENCE COPY IS NOT EDITED. Not tidiness - `tests/test_fork.py`
deliberately excludes that folder from every check so it can be read as-is, and
a suite we have quietly patched is a suite that agrees with us. The redirection
happens here, in a pytest plugin loaded BEFORE the suite's conftest: every
`playwright.X` name is bound to the already-imported `invisible_playwright._pw.X`
object.

⛔ AND THE ALIASES ARE PRE-REGISTERED, ONE OBJECT PER MODULE. Setting only
`sys.modules["playwright"]` would let the import machinery find the submodules
by itself through `_pw/`'s `__path__` - and register a SECOND module object for
the same file, so `isinstance(x, playwright.sync_api.Page)` would be false for a
Page the suite had just been handed. Two objects for one class is the kind of
failure that reads as a product defect for a whole afternoon.
