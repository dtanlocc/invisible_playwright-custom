"""CI drive gate - the firefox-N catcher.

A raw `firefox --screenshot` proves nothing about automation: a juggler-less
binary renders a screenshot just fine and ships broken (firefox-8 did exactly
that). This DRIVES the binary the way users will - Playwright launches it over
the juggler pipe and exercises real paths.

Three levels (see `--click` / `--full`):

  SMOKE (default - run on ALL 5 legs, on every binary's native runner):
    launch over juggler-pipe → navigate a real http://127.0.0.1 page → assert a
    response, the Firefox UA, navigator.webdriver falsy, and a DOM read. This is
    the firefox-8 catcher (a juggler-less binary throws TargetClosedError on
    launch) plus a base stealth + drivability check. It is intentionally LIGHT:
    the free hosted runners - windows-latest especially - are content-process
    unstable under a heavy headless interaction sequence (clicks/moves cascade
    into "context destroyed" / selector-timeout / eval-CSP), so the gate that
    must be GREEN on every leg stays minimal and reliable.

  CLICK (`--click` - run on every leg that is not FULL):
    SMOKE plus ONE mouse move and ONE click, asserting both reached the page.
    Nothing else. It exists because the FULL level below could not run there,
    and that left the mouse untested on the only platforms where it can break.

    ⛔ THE SENTENCE THIS REPLACES WAS WRONG, AND A REAL DEFECT PROVED IT.
    It read: "the interaction code is platform-identical JS (it lives in
    omni.ja), so exercising it on one reliable leg catches a regression for ALL
    platforms". Measured 2026-08-19: a build with MOZILLA_OFFICIAL=1 shows the
    terms-of-use PREONBOARDING MODAL, a full-viewport chrome overlay that
    swallows every mouse event - focus stays on BODY, zero mousedown, zero
    mousemove - while the keyboard keeps working. `browser/app/profile/firefox.js`
    disables preonboarding under `#ifdef XP_LINUX`, so **Linux is immune**: the
    one leg that tested the mouse was the one leg that could not see it. All
    five legs would have been green on a binary whose mouse was dead on Windows
    and macOS, which is the target platform.

    Kept LIGHT on purpose: the flakiness that made FULL Linux-only came from a
    heavy interaction sequence, not from a single click. One move plus one click
    is enough for this defect class - it produces zero events, not wrong ones.

  FULL (`--full` - run on the historically-reliable Linux leg):
    CLICK plus keyboard input (firefox-2 / issue #9:
    jugglerSendMouseEvent/synthesizeMouseEvent), canvas determinism (stealth
    seed must be per-session), and navigator-surface tells.

NOT covered here: WebGL determinism (needs SWGL, false-fails headless) and the
faithful cross-origin iframe test (issue #20) - both live in the local realness
gate. All checks here are headless, no screenshot (GPU-free), loopback-only
(no external network / proxy / secrets) → safe in public CI.

Robustness: a real loopback HTTP page (NOT data: / about:blank - those get
re-normalized / carry an eval-blocking CSP), arrow-function evaluates (never
eval'd), and up to 2 retries on transient context-destroyed/detached/timeout.
A genuinely broken binary fails ALL attempts → the gate fails.

Usage:  python ci_drive_gate.py <firefox-binary> [--click | --full]
Exit 0 + "DRIVE GATE OK ..." on success; non-zero with a reason on failure.

# ⛔ `_REALISTIC_PREFS` USED TO BE HERE, SIX PREFS THAT DISABLED THE NEWTAB.
# Removed 2026-08-20 with the newtab revert, and the reason is that their
# justification had gone false: the comment said "the wrapper always
# disables it (see prefs.py); raw Playwright does not, so the binary's realistic
# config must set it here too". The wrapper no longer disables it - the
# owner ordered the original Mozilla code restored - so
# keeping them here would have run the gate against a configuration the product
# does not ship. A bench that measures a configuration different from what ships
# is not a gate, it's another measurement with the same name.
#
# ⛔ AND THE DANGER THEY DESCRIBED WAS CLOSED AT THE ROOT ON 2026-08-23,
# so no countermeasure remains here at all. It was not Fission reloading the
# page: it was the new tab's PREALLOCATED browser grabbing the page's channel,
# because `JugglerFrameParent` recognized the target by comparing a
# `browserId` against a BrowsingContext's `id`. Fixed in the engine
# (`20-our-patches.md` §5.2w, [B166] in `71-bug-archive.md`).
#
# Between the 20th and 23rd of August there was a `time.sleep(_NEWTAB_SETTLE)` here,
# imported from the wrapper. It was removed along with the constant: measured, the
# wait covered nothing - with the REAL wait, i.e. waiting for `about:newtab` to have
# arrived and loaded, `goto` succeeded 0 times out of 9 - and after the fix in the
# engine, raw Playwright does 10 out of 10 without waiting for anything.
