"""Do the two servers receive the same thing, and answer the same thing?

⛔ THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT DECIDES WHETHER THE NODE DRIVER CAN BE DELETED, and
it is not the same question `judge_both_transports.py` answers. That one runs
tests and reports which arm goes red - a behavioural check, and a coarse one: a
field the client does not happen to read today is missing in complete silence,
and shows up as a bug months later in a code path nobody exercised. This one
compares the WIRE.

**What it compares, and why at this level.**

* **input**: every method the client SENDS, and the set of PARAMETER NAMES it
  sends with each. Both servers must accept the same vocabulary. A method
  present on one side and absent on the other is a hole; a method present on
  both but reached with different fields means the client is being driven
  differently, which makes the rest of the comparison meaningless.
* **output**: every object TYPE the server creates, and the set of INITIALIZER
  FIELD NAMES for each; plus every EVENT name the server emits, per type. This
  is the half that reading `_impl` cannot give you: it tells you which fields
  are CONSUMED today, never which are SENT, and the difference is exactly the
  set a future code path will want.

⛔ **FIELD NAMES, NOT VALUES.** guids are allocated by whoever allocates them,
ports are ephemeral, versions and build ids differ by construction. Comparing
values would drown the real differences in noise that is not a difference at
all. Where a VALUE matters it belongs in a test, not here.

⛔ **AND IT RUNS THE SAME SESSION TWICE, IN TWO SUBPROCESSES.** The transport is
chosen once, at import time, from the environment: two transports in one process
would mean one of the two arms was not the thing it claims to be.

    something the client still holds hands back a dead reference.

    not: this server never disposed a closed page, and the count of live
    objects grew by one per page (9 at page 0, 508 at page 499). Whether that
