"""Which parameters does the client SEND that the server never reads?

⛔ THE INVENTORY THAT COUNTS OPERATIONS CANNOT SEE THIS. `inventario_voce6.py`
derives its coverage from the `METHODS` tables, so it answers "does this name
exist and respond". Both defects that survived the first transport judgement
were names that existed, responded, and threw the argument away:

* `newContext` stored the caller's options on the dispatcher, handed them back
  to the client in the initializer, and never sent one of them to the browser.
  Everything looked wired. A session declaring `timezone_id="America/New_York"`
  reported the host's zone - the exact signal this project exists not to emit.
* `updateSubscription` was a no-op, which is right for every event the server
  emits unconditionally and wrong for `fileChooser`, the one the engine will
  not report until it is told to intercept.

Neither is visible from the operation list, and neither failed loudly. This
compares the two sides that actually matter: **what crosses the wire** against
**what the code reads**.

⛔ THE "SENT" SIDE IS MEASURED, NOT DECLARED. It comes from a real captured
session (`capture_protocol.py`), because a protocol declaration says what MAY be
sent while a trace says what IS. A field the client never sends is not a hole to
fill; a field it sends every session and nobody reads is.

⛔ THE UNIT IS THE OPERATION, and the search walks outwards from it to a
fixed point: the helpers it calls on `self`, the helpers those call, and the
class-level tables any of them name. A per-MODULE search was the first version
and it was too weak - `enabled` is read by some unrelated operation, so
`updateSubscription` would have passed clean. One hop was the second version
and it was too strong - it reported `locale` and `timezoneId` as ignored on an
implementation that reads both through a helper.

    ⛔ IT WALKS TO A FIXED POINT, and each thing it follows is there because
    leaving it out produced a false alarm on real code:

      * `self.other(...)` in the same class, transitively - `op_new_context`
        reads nothing itself and delegates the whole option set to
        `_apply_context_options`, which delegates further;
      * `self.CONSTANT` - that helper reads `params.get(name)` with a VARIABLE,
        and the names live in a class-level table. Without this every field
        driven by a table reads as ignored, which is a gate that cries wolf on
        the very pattern it should be encouraging.

    Recursion between helpers terminates: a method is expanded once.

    A tighter analysis would need real data flow. This one is deliberately
    generous: it can miss a field that is read nowhere but happens to appear as
    a string, and it does not invent faults - and a check that is wrong in the
